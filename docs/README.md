# Welcome to the `node-bullshit-generator` documentation!

`node-bullshit-generator` is a port of the original Python `BullshitGenerator`, which outputs Chinese nonsense, to JavaScript, with added features and improvements.

This is a basic documentation of it.

> Note that the word `dict` used throughout the documentation is a internal term in the library, used for convenience while writing this documentation. It means `dictionary`.
