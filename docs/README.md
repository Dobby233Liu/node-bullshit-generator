# Welcome to the `node-bullshit-generator` documentation!

`node-bullshit-generator` is a library that generates Chinese bullshit.
It is a port of the Python-based [`BullshitGenerator`](https://github.com/menzi11/BullshitGenerator) originally by menzi11 to Node.js, with added features and improvements.
This is a basic and **unfinished** documentation of the library.

**Due of this document's unfinished nature, please be very careful while using it.**

> Note that an abbreviation of `dictionary`, `dict` (and also an internal term in the library), is used for convenience when this documentation was written.
