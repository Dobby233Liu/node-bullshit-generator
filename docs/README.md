# Welcome to the `node-bullshit-generator` documentation!

`node-bullshit-generator` is a port of the original Python `BullshitGenerator`, which outputs Chinese nonsense, to JavaScript, with added features and improvements.

This is a basic documentation of it.

> Note that an abbreviation of `dictionary`, `dict` (and also an internal term in the library), is used for convenience while writing this documentation.
