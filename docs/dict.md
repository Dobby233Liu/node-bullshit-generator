Dicts are simply JavaScript objects, that when supplied to the 生成 functions, alters the text data and even the generating behaviour of by the generator.
Usually, you can just use [the dicts included with the library](packeddicts.md), however sometimes you may want to make one on your own.
This page roughly describes the progress of making a dict for the library.
